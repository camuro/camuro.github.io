css: math.css

This is an example document. Inline: $a$, $b$, $q$ and stop.

$$        \int_a^b f(x) dx       $$     (1)

See for example (eq:1).

Equation inline: $  \int_a^b f(x) dx $ and that's it.


Spacing: Maruku outputs sizes and alignment for images in `ex`. An `ex` is one `x`:
x, $\textrm{x}$, $x$ should have the same height.
